# Lecture 12 - Problems

### Goals:

* Be able to implement `peek`.
* Be able to analyze the runtime of `add`, `peek`, and `poll` in a heap.

1. Is a sorted array a heap?

2. Here's a barebones `Heap` class that just stores integers:

   ```java
   public class Heap {
     int[] A;
     int size;
     
     // other methods here
     
     /** Return the smallest value in the heap without modifying the heap.
       * Precondition: size >= 1 */
     public int peek() {
       // code here
     }
   }
   ```

   Implement the `peek` operation. Hint: it's not a lot of code!

For the following problems, you may use without proof the fact that the height of a heap is O($\log n$).

3. Analyze the runtime of `add`.

4. Analyze the runtime of `peek`.

5. Analyze the runtime of `poll`.

6. Consider the `changePriority` operation of the A3 `PriorityQueue` interface, which has the following spec and header:

   ```java
   /** Change the priority associated with value v to p.
    *  Precondition: v is in the heap. */
   public void changePriority(V v, P p);
   ```

   In A3, a value (of type `V`) and its associated priority (of type `P`) are stored together in a wrapper class called `Entry`, which simply has a `value` field and a `priority` field. The backing storage is then an array of type `Entry`, so each node in the tree carries around both its value and its priority.

   Devise an algorithm to implement `changePriority` as efficiently as possible and give its runtime. *Hint:* it may not be all that efficient.
