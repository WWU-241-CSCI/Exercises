# Lecture 13 - Problems

Here is the same barebones `Heap` class we've seen already, with method specs and headers but no implementation.

```java
public class Heap {
  int[] A;
  int size;
  
  /** Add the value v to the heap. */
  public void add(int v);
  
  /** Return the smallest value in the heap without modifying the heap.
    * Precondition: size >= 1 */
  public int peek();
  
  /** Remove and return the minimum value in the heap.
    * Precondition: size >= 1 */
  public int poll();

}
```

1. The kind of heap we've been talking about are formally called "min-heaps", because the minimum value is always at the root. It is also possible to create a "max-heap", where the maximum value is at the root. How do we need to change the definition (properties) of a heap to switch it from a min-heap to a max-heap?

2. There is a sorting algorithm called HeapSort. How do you think this might work? Write some pseudocode for a method `heapSort(int[] a)` that uses a `Heap` like the one above to sort an array of integers. What is the runtime of your algorithm? Is it in-place? Stable?

3. It turns out to be possible to write an in-place version of `HeapSort` using a max-heap. To get you started, here's a max-heap version of the `Heap` class above with a couple extra methods added. The first is a constructor that takes an array of unsorted values and sets that to be the Heap's internal storage array:

   ```java
   public class Heap {
     int[] A;
     int size;
     
     /** Constructor: initialize a heap with an unsorted array of values
       * as the backing storage. Although A has values, size is 0 so the 
       * heap starts out empty. */
     public Heap(int[] unsorted_array) {
       A = unsorted_array;
       size = 0;
     }
       
     /** Add the value v to the heap. */
     public void add(int v);
     
     /** Return the largest value in the heap without modifying the heap.
       * Precondition: size >= 1 */
     public int peek();
     
     /** Remove and return the largest value in the heap.
       * Precondition: size >= 1 */
     public int poll();
   
     /** Sort the values in A in-place using heapsort. 
       * Precondition: the heap is empty and A contains all values to be sorted.
       * Postcondition: the heap is empty and A's values are in sorted order. */
     public void heapSort() {
       // your code here
     }
   }
   ```

   The second method is the `heapSort()` method, which sorts the values in `A` in-place. Implement the `heapSort` method.
   
4. The most straightforward way to insert $n$ elements into a heap is to call `add` $n$ times, which is $O(n \log n)$. However, it turns out to be possible to build a heap of $n$ relements in $O(n$) time. There are two tricky parts to this: the algorithm to build the heap, and the analysis to show that it's $O(n)$. In short, the approach is to build the heap "bottom-up" instead of "top-down".

   1. Write pseudocode to implement the following method, which could be a member of the `Heap` class above:

      ```java
      /** Swap i down to its appropriate position in the bottom-up collection
        * of heaps thus far constructed.
        * Preconditions:
        *  - i's left subtree is nonempty
        *  - i's left subtree and right subtree (if it exists) are max-heaps
        * Postcondition: the subtree rooted at i is a max-heap
        */
      private void maxHeapify(int i) {
        // your code here
      }
      ```

   2. Noticing that a single value is always a valid heap, write pseudocode for the following, making use of the `maxHeapify` method above:

      ```java
      /** Build a max heap from from the contents of A.
        * Postcondition: A[0] is the root of a max-heap */
      public void maxHeapify() {
        // your code here
      }
      ```

   3. For a given call to `maxHeapify(i)`, the runtime is $O(\log n)$ where $n$ is the number of nodes in the tree rooted at `i`. Although   `maxHeapify()` makes $O(n)$ calls to the private helper, it's possible to show that it only does a total of $O(n)$ work. Prove this. *Hint:* the analysis is similar to the analysis of the recursive `height` calculation in AVL trees that we saw in Lecture 11 Problem 3.
