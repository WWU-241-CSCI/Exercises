Day 0 - Problems

### Syllabus Questions

1. What are you required to do to prepare for each class?
2. Where can you find the lecture videos, slides, exercises, and problems?
3. How many missed classes are allowed without making arrangements with the Professor?
4. What is a slip day, how many are you allowed, and how do you use one?

### Review Problems

5. What is printed by the following pseudocode? Reminder: in Java, a Stack's `push` method pushes an element onto the stack, while the `pop` method pops an element off the stack and returns it.

   ```java
   Stack s = new Stack();
   s.push(8);
   System.out.println(s.pop());
   s.push(10);
   s.push(4);
   System.out.println(s.size());
   System.out.println(s.pop() - s.pop());
   ```

6. What is printed by the following pseudocode? Reminder: in Java, a Queue's `add` method enqueues an element, and its `remove` method dequeues and returns an element.

   ```java
   Queue q = new Queue();
   q.add(8);
   System.out.println(q.remove());
   q.add(10);
   q.add(4);
   System.out.println(q.size());
   System.out.println(q.remove() - q.remove());
   ```

7. Implement (in java-like pseudocode) the following method:

   ```java
   /** Reverse the elements of a in-place */
   public static void reverse(int[] a) {
   
     // your code here
     
   }
   ```

8. Implement (in java-like pseudocode) the following method; you may use extra storage, but the end result must be that `s` contains the same elements but in reverse order:

   ```java
   /** Reverse the elements of s in-place */
   public static void reverse(Stack s) {
   
     // your code here
     
   }
   ```

9. The `Node` class below defines a doubly-linked list node:

   ```java
   public class Node {
     int value;
     Node next;
     Node prev;
   }
   ```

   Implement (in java-like pseudocode) the following method:

   ```java
   /** Reverse the order of the doubly linked list with the given head node. */
   public static void reverse(Node head) {
     
     // your code here
     
   }
   ```
