# Lecture 5 - Problems

1. Analyze the runtime of merge sort if, for some reason, you split the array 1/3 left and 2/3 right.
2. Analyze the runtime of merge sort if, for some reason, you split the array such that only two elements are in the left "half", and all remaining elements are in the right. To make this algorithm work, assume that we also add a base case for size 2 that swaps the two elements if they're out of order.
3. In which divide-and-conquer phase (divide, conquer, combine) is all the "real work" of mergesort performed for merge sort? In other words, in which phase do the values end up actually being rearranged?
4. Derive an expression for the *number of calls* to `mergeSort` that result from an initial call with array size $2^k$.
