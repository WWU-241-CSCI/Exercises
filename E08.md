3. What’s the root of G’s right subtree? 
4. List the ancestors of F. 
5. What’s C’s parent? 
6. List the nodes at depth 1?
7. List the nodes that are the root of a subtree of height 0.
8. What's the height of the tree rooted at G?

### 8C

10. Write the nodes in the order they are visited by a **pre-order** traversal.
11. Write the nodes in the order they are visited by a **in-order** traversal.
12. Write the nodes in the order they are visited by a **post-order** traversal.
