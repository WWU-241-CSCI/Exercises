# Lecture 19 - Problems

1. In a BST or AVL Tree, the order of insertion determines the tree's structure. Is the same true for Tries?

Some basic skeleton code for the following problems can be found [here](L19_code/TrieNode.java), with some helpful details filled in and a few (very) cursory test cases. Feel free to develop your code on a computer and see if it works!

2. A basic and non-generic `TrieNode` class for a Set of Strings is defined as follows:

   ```java
   class TrieNode {
     HashMap<String, TrieNode> children;
     boolean terminates;
   }
   ```

   Implement the `insert` operation, which is an instance method of the `TrieNode` class:

   ```java
   /** Insert word into the Set represented by this trie.
    * Returns whether the Set changed. Precondition: word is not null. */
   public boolean insert(String word) {
     
     // your code here
     
   }
   ```

2. Write code for the following method, which is a static method that takes a `TrieNode` as an argument:

   ```java
   /** Return the number of words in the trie rooted at n that begin with
    * the given prefix. If the prefix itself is a word, that is counted.
    * Precondition: prefix is not null. */
   public static int prefixFrequency(TrieNode n, String prefix) {
    
     // your code here
     
   }
   ```

3. What's the worst-case runtime of the method from Problem 2?

4. Suppose we need to calculate prefix frequencies more efficiently than that.

   1. Modify the `TrieNode` class above to support a `prefixFrequency` that operates in constant time (you'll need to use some extra storage in exchange for a faster runtime).

   2. Write code for `prefixFrequency` (same spec as above) that operates on your modified `TrieNode` and runs in O(1) time.

   3. Modify your code for `insert` (same spec as above) to work with the modified `TrieNode`.
