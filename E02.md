# Exercises - Lecture 2

### 2A

1. Consider the following Java method:
   ```java
   /** Swap A[i] with A[j] 
     * Precondition: 0 <= i, j < A.length */
   public static void swap(int[] A, int i, int j) {
     int tmp = A[i];
     A[i] = A[j];
     A[j] = tmp
   }
   ```
   Which of the following are constant-time operations?
   a. Retrieving the value of `i` from memory in the first line of the method body
   b. Storing the value of `tmp` at `A[j]`
   c. All of the line `int tmp = A[i]`
   d. Calling `swap(X, 2, 7)`, where `X` is an `int[]`

2. Recall our linear search method:

   ```java
   /** Return the index of x in A, or -1 if it doesn't exist. */
   public static int linearSearch(int[] A, int x) {
     for (int i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {
       if (A[i] == x) {
         return i;
       }
     }
     return -1;
   }
   ```
   Which of the following are constant-time operations?
   
   a. `return i;`
   b. Executing the comparison `A[i] == x`
   c. Calling `linearSearch(X, 17)`, where `X` is an `int[]`

### 2B

3. Give the asymptotic runtime class (big-O runtime) for an algorithm with each of the following operation counts:
   a. $4N + 6$
   b. $\frac{N^3}{4} - 7$
   c. $842$

Here's `linearSearch` again:

```java
/** Return the index of x in A, or -1 if it doesn't exist. */
public static int linearSearch(int[] A, int x) {
  for (int i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {
    if (A[i] == x) {
      return i;
    }
  }
  return -1;
}
```

4. Let $N$ be the size of `A[]`. In terms of $N$, give the number of primitive operations performed by a call to`linearSearch` if `x` does not appear anywhere in `A`. As we did in the examples from the video, follow the convention that any number of constant-time operations performed by a single line of code count as one.
5. Give asymptotic runtime class of `linearSearch` based on the above count.
6. Could the runtime class you gave in #5 be different if you counted every single primitive operation rather than grouping them per-line? Why or why not?
7. Now assume that the value `x` appears at `A[0]`. What is the operation count in this situation?
8. If for some reason we knew that `x` will always appear at `A[0]`, what would the big-O (asymptotic) runtime of the algorithm be?

### 2C

9. What's the best, worst, and average case asymptotic runtime class for the following algorithm? For average case, assume that any value of `n` is equally likely.

   ```java
   /** Print some numbers. Pre: n >= 0 */
   public static void alg2(int n) {
     n *= 4;
     if (n % 5 == 0) {
       System.out.println("42");
       return;
     }
     while (n > 0) {
       System.out.println(n);
       n /= 2;
     }
   }
   ```
