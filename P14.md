# Lecture 14 - Problems

### Goals

* Know how to implement the Set ADT using a hash table.
* Analyze the worst-case and average-case runtime of hash table `insert`, `contains`, and `remove`.
* Know how to implement the Map ADT using any Set implementation.

1. Hash tables can be used to implement the Set ADT. Write pseudocode for the three main Set operations, `insert`, `contains`, `remove` for the HashSet below, which is specific to integers.

   ```java
   public class IntHashSet {
     LinkedList<Integer>[] A; // an array of LinkedList<Integer>s
     // assume a constructor is implemented that instantiates A
     
     /** insert value into the set. return false if the value
       * was already in the set, true otherwise */
     boolean insert(int value);
     
     /** return true if value is in the set, 
       * false otherwise */
     boolean contains(int value);
     
     /** remove value from the set. return true if the
       * value was in the set, false otherwise */
     boolean remove(int value);
   }
   ```

   

2. What's the minimum and maximum load factor of a hash table that uses chaining for collision resolution?

In the following problems, assume that the hash function can be computed in constant time.

3. What are the worst-case runtime classes of `contains`, `remove`, and `insert` in a HashSet that has $N$ entries and capacity $C$?
6. Like quicksort, hash tables have the unusual property that the average case runtime is not the same as the worst case. Under some reasonable assumptions, the average-case time to find an element in a hash table is the time to search the bucket in which the element is stored. This means the average-case runtime is determined by the average size of a bucket. If the array size (capacity) is $C$ and the load factor is $\lambda$, what is the average bucket size? What does this mean for the average-case runtime of `contains`, `remove`, and `insert`?
8. Suppose you have a generic implementation of the Set ADT that can store a Set of any single type (akin to the `IntHashSet` from above, but generic). Describe how you could go about using the Set to implement a Map. Describe any initial setup needed, then for each Map method (`get`, `put`, `remove`) describe how you would implement it using the Set's methods (`insert`, `contains`, `remove`). *Hint:* Consider this perspective: a Map is very much like a Set of key-value pairs in which the keys are unique.
