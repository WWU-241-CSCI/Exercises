# Exercises - Lecture 18

### 18A

1. What is the length of the shortest path from node 3 to node 6 in the following graph (you don't need to use Dijkstra's algorithm)?

2. Execute Dijkstra's algorithm (without backpointers) on the following graph starting from Node A. As I did in the slides, set up a table to maintain d-values and a place to keep track of the Frontier and Settled sets. Break ties alphabetically. Your answer should give the final table of d-values and the Settled set in the order nodes entered it.

### 18B

3. Repeat the previous exercise, but maintain backpointers and start from Node D.
