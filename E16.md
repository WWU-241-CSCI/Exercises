# Exercises - Lecture 16



### 16A

1. Draw a diagram of the following undirected graph:
   $$
   V = \{a, b, c, d, e\}
   $$
   $$
   E = \{(a, c), (d, a), (c, d), (a, e), (b, e)\}
   $$
   In the above graph, what is |E|?

2. Write the formal set-based representation for the following directed graph:
