### 4A

The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1. After that, the $n$th fibonacci number, denoted $f(n)$, is the sum of the prior two ($f(n-2) + f(n-1)$). Here's a table with the first few values in the sequence:

| $n$    | 0    | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6    | 7    | 8    |
| ------ | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| f($n$) | 0    | 1    | 1    | 2    | 3    | 5    | 8    | 13   | 21   |

Here's some pseudocode for a method that calculates the $n$th fibonacci number:

```python
fib(n):
  if n <= 1:
    return n;
  return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```

1. If I call `fib(3)`, how many times is `fib` called in total (including the call to `fib(3)`)?
2. What value does it return?
3. If I call `fib(4)`, how many times is `fib` called in total?
4. Excluding the time it takes to make any recursive calls, what is the asymptotic runtime of each call to `fib`?

### 4B

5. Find the two bugs in the following pseudocode. Hint: refer back to the four-step procedure for understanding recursive methods.

   ```java
   duplicate(String s):
     if s.length() == 0:
     	return s
   
     return s[0] + s[0] + duplicate(s)
   ```


6. You asked to write a recursive method with the following specification:

   ```java
   /** Sum the digits of n. Precondition: n >= 0. */
   ```

   Devise a recursive definition of the solution to this problem for all $n > 0$. *Hint*: consider using mod and integer division.

7. Write a line of code to replace the TODO comment in the method below to implement your recursive definition and correctly complete the method.

   ```java
   /** Sum the digits of n. Precondition: n >= 0. */
   public static int sumDigits(int n) {
     if (n == 0) {
       return 0;
     }
     // TODO recursive case
   }
   ```

### 4C

8. T/F Selection sort is an incremental algorithm.
9. Because it splits the array in half at each step, we can describe binary search as a divide-and-conquer algorithm. Describe the operations performed in a single iteration of binary search in terms of divide, conquer, and combine phases. Keep in mind that some steps may be trivial (i.e., nothing needs to be done).
   * Divide:
   * Conquer:
   * Combine:
